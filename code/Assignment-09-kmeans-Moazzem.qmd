# Goal of this assignment  
The goal of this assignment is for you to **explore the k-means algorithm** learned in class.  

In specific, you will be asked to:  
  - Use a different number of k than what we did in class,  
  - Validate the results of the new model, and  
  - Compare your results with those found in class  

# Instructions  
You will first need to watch (and code along with) the following k-means video:

  - k-means lab: https://youtu.be/GFgMp5tYiMU?si=CI0E-2r-cYZLGVL1 (start from beginning of video, watch till the 01:10)  
  - The partial script for the video above is in our GitHub repository, 04-classcode, **03-25_multivar_kmeans_partial.qmd**. Move the script mentioned above into the `code` subfolder of your `10_multivar` project
  
**AFTER watching the video and developing the code in class**, then start working on this HW assignment (instructions below):

  - Move this script into the `code` subfolder of your `10_multivar` project  
  - On this script, fill your name under the `title` section of the YAML  
  - Go back to the class k-means script, choose a different number of k than what we did in class, and run it.
  
### Setup    

```{r setup}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

#install.packages("ggcorrplot")
#install.packages("factoextra")
#install.packages("ggpmisc")

library(tidyverse)
library(ggcorrplot)
library(broom)
library(car)
library(factoextra)
library(ggpmisc)
```


### Importing data  

```{r importing data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
weather <- read_csv("../data/weather_monthsum.csv")
```

## Data warngling

### Selecting only numerical variables

```{r selecting only numerical vars, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
weather_n <- weather %>%
  dplyr::select(-c(year:strength_gtex))

```

### Normalizing data

```{r normalizing data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# normalizing the data
weather_norm  <- weather_n %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~scale(.)) )


```

### Creating 5 clusters

```{r mod_km5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

mod_km5 <- kmeans(weather_norm,
                  centers = 5, #now we have 5 clusters
                  nstart = 10
                  )

```

# Questions  
## 1. What number of k did you select? Why?  

I selected 5 clusters because based on the clouds of data points in the PCA plot for PC1 vs PC2 obtained during the in-class "03-25_multivar_pca_partial_Shakir.qmd" exercise as shown below, it seems to me that the existence of 5 clusters may be very possible. 

```{r embedding PC1 vs PC2 PCA plot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("../output/PC1vsPC2.png")

```


## 2. How many observations are there in each cluster?  

The number of observations in each cluster is given in the following table:

```{r obs per cluster, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

weather %>%
  mutate(cluster = mod_km5$cluster) %>% #to create a column with cluster id
  dplyr::select(year, site, cluster) %>%
  group_by(cluster) %>%
  tally() #To get the length of each of the cluster

```


## 3. Using the `fviz_cluster()` function, import here the original plot with k=4 did in class, and the new one with the number of k you selected for this exercise. How do they visually compare? Which one seems to be a better choice, and why?  


```{r original plot}

knitr::include_graphics("../output/clustervalidation_class.png")

```

The original cluster plot with k = 4 as created in class is shown above.  

```{r kmeans PCA plot}

fviz_cluster(mod_km5,
             data = weather_norm
             )

ggsave("../output/clustervalidation_assignment.png",
       width = 7,
       height = 5) 

```
The newly-created cluster plot with k = 5 for this assignment is shown above.  

In terms of visual comparison, the cluster plot created in the class has 4 distinct clusters whereas the newly-created cluster plot in this assignment has 5 clusters. Also, it appears that there is no cluster overlapping one another in the cluster plot with 4 clusters created in the class, whereas at least two clusters are overlapping in the cluster plot with 5 clusters created in this assignment.

It seems to me that choosing 4 clusters instead of 5 is a better choice because we are able to avoid overlapping of clusters when the number of cluster are selected as 4 (k = 4) instead of 5.

# Submitting your work  
Once you have developed all the code and answers, make sure to Render this quarto file.  

**Notes on rendering**:  

- Make sure to render your work and inspect how the final html look like.  
- If it does not look professional for whatever reason, then fix the issue, re-render it, recheck.  
- Only send me your work once your html file looks professional.  
  - **DO NOT** delete the file's heading levels (# and ##). They set up the proper heading 1 and 2 levels, and I use them to guide my grading.  
  - If a given chunk is also outputting warnings or messages, inhibit this behavior by changing the chunk options `message` and `warning` to `FALSE` (I'll demo this in a moment).  
  
  - If, after rendered, 2 lines of text are connected and you wish to "break line" between them, add 2 extra spaces after the first one (I'lld demo this in a moment).  

After rendering, an .html file will be created on your `code` folder.  

Rename this file to `Assignment-09-kmeans-LASTNAME.html`.    

For ex., mine would be `Assignment-09-kmeans-Bastos.html`.

Submit your work by uploading the **html** file to **eLC Assignment #9 - K-means** by April 3rd 11:59 pm.
